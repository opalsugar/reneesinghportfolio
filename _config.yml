description: Hi, I’m Renee, and I’m a senior double majoring in Informatics - Data Science and Economics, graduating next Spring. I’m passionate about leveraging data science methodologies and my knowledge of financial economics to optimize business operations and drive commercial decision-making. Previously, I was a Business Intelligence intern at an international maritime shipping company, where I gained experience identifying key insights from large datasets and translating them into actionable solutions that align with stakeholder needs. I’m also passionate about misinformation, and have contributing to a study on modernizing media literacy education for teenagers for the past year, and I also serve as a first-year representative for Women in Informatics, where I’ve organized professional events including industry panels and last month’s 13th Hackathon, creating networking and professional development opportunities for students. I’m currently exploring internships for Summer 2025, and believe that through my initiative to take ownership of projects, emphasizing goal-oriented solutions development, I can drive strategic, data-driven decision making.
