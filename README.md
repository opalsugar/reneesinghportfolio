## Featured Projects

### Python

#### Evaluation of Machine Learning and Deep Learning Algorithms for Deepfake Image Detection

Developed and optimized robust deepfake detection models using Support Vector Classifier and Multi-Layer Perceptron and fine-tuning hyperparameters with GridSearch cross validation to achieve an 82% accuracy rate on test data, demonstrating strong performance in identifying AI-generated content in real-world scenarios. Preprocessed a dataset of 2,000 real and AI-generated facial images, applying grayscale conversion and eigenface principal component analysis to extract key visual features, such as texture irregularities, color distortions, and high-frequency noise that serve as indicators of AI-generated content.

#### Census Health Metrics MongoDB Database Design and Optimization (In Progress)

Designed and implemented a scalable MongoDB health metrics database, optimizing schema design with nested arrays and indexing strategies to enhance query performance, scalability, and data retrieval efficiency. Leveraged Python to implement ETL processes, extracting relational data, transforming it into a non-relational format, and loading it into MongoDB, streamlining the migration of large-scale census health data and optimizing data integration workflows. Developed and optimized complex aggregation queries to extract insights from large-scale census health data, improving query execution runtimes by 30%.

### Software Architecture

#### System Design for Smart Lock Data Platform

Designed the high-level software architecture for a scalable, event-driven data platform for smart home security devices, leveraging AWS, Azure, and NoSQL databases to define real-time data validation processes and facilitate system communication. Clarified ambiguity in system requirements by defining MVP features, identifying dependencies, and prioritizing features. Developed REST API contracts to ensure seamless data exchange between components, focusing on reliability and low-latency communication. Outlined comprehensive logging, monitoring, and alerting schemas to improve system observability and guide fault-tolerant design.
